      <p><strong>Good</strong>: Buildings are clean, structurally sound, well-kept, free of graffiti, and secured. No more than two minor repairs (some paint needed). Lots are actively used and well maintained, grass cut low, and landscaping/gardens present.
         </p>           
      <p><strong>Fair</strong>: Building requires three or more minor repairs (or one major repair). Structurally sound and can still be rehabilitated fairly inexpensively (repair door, window, porch). Lot is less well maintained, but still attended. Parking lot may have small amounts of debris or grass on it.
        </p>            
      <p><strong>Poor</strong>: Only a few signs of maintenance. May not be structurally sound, major repairs needed (broken windows, missing door, broken fa√ßade, porch missing, poor roof condition) Building needs major repairs. Lot has few signs of maintenance, grass or trees are tall. Parking lot may be significantly cracked or has debris or weeds on it.
               </p>
      <p><strong>Demolish</strong>: Building needs to be demolished, may pose safety risks. Not structurally sound (major fire damage, roof caved in, leaning structure). Dumping or large amounts of debris present.
