h1. Neighborhood Survey Mobile

We want to make it very easy for neighborhood organizations to collect good
information about the things they care about, like property condition, 
vacancy, points of interest, and more.  

This project is part of a toolkit we're building:
* A survey builder tool 
* A mobile data collection app 
* A paper-based survey that's easy to 
* A "small server":https://github.com/codeforamerica/survey-api to store and retrieve the results 

Very much in prototype stage. Interested in helping out? Contact 
detroit@codeforamerica.org for more details.

h2. The maps

The maps used in this app are rendered with TileMill. They use street data 
from OpenStreetMap and parcel data from local municipalities (right now,
Detroit and San Francisco).

Here are the basic steps we followed -- please feel free to contact us with 
questions about the details:
# Download street data from the "Metrio city extracts":http://metro.teczno.com/. 
You'll want the "9.2 MB osm2pgsql shapefiles." 
# Get a shapefile with parcel data from your local municipality. 
# Use TileMill to create and style map that combines those two data sources.
You can get started with the "TileMill tutorial":http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/introduction/ 
# Export the map as MBTiles
# Upload the map to the "MapBox hosted service":http://mapbox.com/plans/
# Use the TileJSON URL in this app.
